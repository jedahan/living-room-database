# living-room-database

RoomDB is a Datalog-style database inspired by the implementation of the [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) project. It enables programmers to represent facts using natural language, with a syntax adapted from my [NL-Datalog project](https://github.com/harc/nl-datalog).

It is based off of [RoomDB][] by alexwarth, but has diverged enough to be its own thing for now
